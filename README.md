RandomMovieToWatchGenerator:

This project helps people like me to pick a random "Movie Name" so that i dont have to waste my time thinking which movie i should watch.

With "The Movie DB" api it makes easier to get a list of movies and then my software automagially picks the rigt movie for the user!

Just press "which movie i should watch?" button and wait for the software to automagically suggest the movie name to watch!

How to run:
"sudo python main.py"

UI:
